# Python Data Structures & Algorithms – From Scratch 🐍

Welcome to my personal learning journey into **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **pure Python** – no built-in shortcuts, just raw logic and hands-on fundamentals.

## 📌 Objective

To build a strong foundation in core DSA concepts by solving problems from scratch — without relying on Python's built-in helpers.

> ✨ Goal: Understand *how things work* under the hood, not just how to use them.

## 🎓 Inspiration & Learning Style

This learning journey is inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeYmVEtae2A&t=4s), which shares two key pieces of advice for mastering algorithms and data structures:

1️⃣ **Use Gradual Progression** — Start simple, then build up slowly.

2️⃣ **Do Boring Variations** — Repeat core patterns in different ways until they stick.

This repo follows that mindset — start with the basics, master them, then apply them in slightly different ways again and again.
